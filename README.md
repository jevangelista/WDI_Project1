* User can navigate to different pages with navbar.


### Technologies Used
MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose.js, Express.js, Twit, Express-session, Bcrypt, jQuery, HTML, CSS.

 
###Planned features
In the next iteration of the project, I would like to make the drink recommendation process more dynamic. Currently, the recommendations are hard-coded. By making it more dynamic, I would serve up the drink based on how they're feeling, and also add a random aspect to it. Also, I would like to create update actions, so that a user can update their profile with new drinks, as well as delete drinks. A couple of stretch goals for the next iteration would be incorporating more JQuery with the use of hover and animations, as well as integrating an external API, such as Yelp or Google Maps to locate bars with a particular drink.
